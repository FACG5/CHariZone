# ChariZone

## What:
Charizone is a platoform that has all charities UK based with the aim of presenting their information and data to 
the user in a friendly and convenient manner so that the process of donation and browsing charities is easier and faster.

---
## Problem Statment:
There are a number of websites that offer information on charity, but we noticed that such websities in the UK are not user friendly and present information in a manner that comes off as dreary. So, we aim at improving the donation experience and presenting the information in a palatable manner to the user.

---
## Our Solution: 
We went for an easy simple layout with eye-pleasing and comforting colors. We also tried to simplifiy the presentation of the charities data as much as possibe and also aimed at specific yet not overly stuffy manner.
